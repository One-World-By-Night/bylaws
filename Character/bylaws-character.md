The Bylaws of One World by Night

  

*One World by Night (OWbN) is a network of international Live Action
Role Play (LARP) chronicles. These chronicles are brought together for
the purpose of sharing a broad and colorful story that extends past each
city’s borders. We believe in the sovereignty of each chronicle, so far
as it does not impugn upon the cohesiveness of the organization as a
whole. We further believe that treating each chronicle, and by extension
each player, with respect is the bedrock upon which sound cooperative
Storytelling takes place.*

  

Character Regulation Bylaws of One World By Night

  

Last Revised: January 25, 2024

  

1.  Home Chronicle
    1.  A player character (PC) must be based in one, and only one, OWbN
        member chronicle.
    2.  Changing a PC's home chronicle requires the approval of the Head
        Storyteller or the majority of the Storytelling Staff of both
        the chronicle being left and the chronicle being joined.
        1.  A PC cannot be transferred to a different home chronicle for
            the purposes of evading the authority of a storyteller crew
            or avoiding the consequences of their IC actions.
        2.  Players that wish to transfer their characters but are
            unable to obtain their home chronicle’s approval can ask the
            OWbN Executive Team to mediate their dispute, should the
            denial be given in bad faith. To that end, evidence of the
            unfair treatment needs to be provided to the Executive Team
            for evaluation, who can refuse any case based on lack of
            proof.
            1.  For the duration of the dispute the Executive Team gains
                administrative control of the character and the
                character cannot be played without permission of the
                Executive Team.
            2.  The dispute shall be solved within 30 days of it being
                accepted by the Executive team.
            3.  Any extension of that period must be agreed upon by the
                player in question or brought before Council.
            4.  The Executive Team's decision on the matter will be
                final and notified to all the involved parties.

2.  Character Creation
    1.  Every character must be designated as a PC (portrayed by
        players) or NPC (portrayed by Storytellers/Narrators).
        1.  A PC can be turned into an NPC at any time by its home
            chronicle Storytelling Staff.
        2.  A NPC can be turned into a PC with a proposal for a Council
            Simple Majority Vote as long as the character meets all of
            the creation guidelines for a new character.

    <!-- -->

    2.  Every character must be designated with one, and only one, of
        the following Statuses, to be determined by its home chronicle
        Storytelling staff:
        1.  Active – These characters are portrayed regularly within
            OWbN
        2.  Inactive / Shelved – These characters are not being
            regularly portrayed within OWbN
        3.  Retired – These characters had their stories ended and their
            players committed to never play it again. They are
            considered to be NPCs under the property of the Chronicle
            they were retired in (unless otherwise specified via Binding
            Agreement). They may not re-enter play as PCs without
            following the guidelines presented above for NPC to PC
            conversion
        4.  Dead – These characters have been destroyed and are no
            longer eligible to be played. A Dead character can be
            resurrected, as per the guidelines in the Controlled Items
            Section.

    <!-- -->

    3.  Every PC must be associated with one player, as they cannot be
        transferred between players
        1.  A PC may only be be portrayed by someone other than it's
            original player with ST oversight for up to 3 game sessions
        2.  PCs taken over by the soul of past diableries are exempt
            from this rule

    <!-- -->

    4.  No single player may create multiple characters related to,
        allied with, or otherwise possessing knowledge of each other.
        1.  Players may not investigate the death of their previous
            character with their new character. Should they become
            involved involuntarily into such an investigation, they must
            report this activity to their storytellers, to avoid
            metagaming.
        2.  A single player’s multiple characters may eventually gain
            knowledge of each other but may never work together,
            directly or indirectly.

    <!-- -->

            age or Diablerize, commonly known as the Darkening, has been
            removed and no longer exists in One World by Night Canon.

    <!-- -->

    6.  Vampire Characters cannot be created without the involvement of
        a Sire for that Character.

            in the Character's back story for the purposes as serving as
            the Character's Sire.
        2.  Vitae stored in any form is not a viable method for enacting
            the Embrace
            1.  Clans who have specific rituals that allows the usage of
                Stored Vitae for Embracing are exempt to this rule.

    <!-- -->

        creation. For the purpose of this regulation, sects are the
        Camarilla, Sabbat, Anarch, Independent, Ashiraa. Laibon, Jati,

        1.  The Membership Coordinator must verify if an application has
            been submitted and is under review by the independent

            Council two weeks (or more) prior to usage unless that
            location exists within the territory currently owned by an
            OWbN member chronicle in which case the member chronicle in
            whose territory it exists may use the location freely within
            the following guidelines.
            1.  If the canon location is currently claimed by another
                party (Coordinator, Game) and is not part of the status
                quo, approval must be sought from the party who has
                registered the location as claimed. This may require the
                use of a Binding Agreement between parties detailing how
                the location may be used.

        <!-- -->

        2.  A game or Coordinator using a canon location may not affect
            that location in such a way as to;
            1.  Substantially alter the genre as a whole unless the OWbN
                bylaws otherwise allow such use;
            2.  Destroy that canon location without a council passed
                proposal that has received 2/3 of the vote;

        <!-- -->

        3.  Use of a location does not grant use of named canon NPCs
            associated with that location. Use of named canon NPCs
            should follow the guidelines found under the heading
            “Published Canon Characters,” (Character bylaw 5.c)
        4.  An individual (Game or Coordinator) wishing to claim sole or
            shared ownership of a canon location that exists within
            someone else’s (Game or Coordinator) claimed territory must
            demonstrate either;
            1.  That they have acquired support of the Game or
                Coordinator who claims the territory;
            2.  That the individual (Game or Coordinator) the location
                is claimed by, has used the location in such a way as to
                violate character bylaw 5.ii.

    <!-- -->

    2.  Items
        1.  The usage of specific unique objects mentioned in the White
            Wolf books (i.e. True Cross, Siklos, etc) requires a Council
            Simple Majority Vote.
            1.  A chronicle wishing for such an object must present a
                request to the OWbN Council, detailing why and the
                length of time that the object is required.
                1.  If approved, the chronicle gets the object for the
                    length of time specified, after which the item is
                    considered out of play.
                    1.  Should the object end up in the hands of a
                        player, the Storytelling staff will inform the
                        player of the object disappearance (when the
                        specified voted length of time ends) or, if
                        deemed unobtrusive to the integrity of OWbN
                        continuity, Council will appoint a liaison (such
                        as a Coordinator) to monitor its usage.

                <!-- -->

                2.  It is possible to allow the free usage of said
                    object by the Chronicle, without stipulation of time
                    or its removal, should that be specified in the
                    proposal. This provision allows the possibility of
                    said object being destroyed, harmed, or otherwise
                    altered due to PC and NPC interaction.

    <!-- -->

    3.  Published Canon Characters
        1.  Characters that have been published by White Wolf are to be
            automatically considered controlled by the appropriate
            Coordinator and are thusly exempted from voting requirements
            to use these unique characters.
            1.  Should there be a conflict of custody of a published
                canon character, the parties seeking joint control of
                the character can petition the Executive Team for
                mediation.
                1.  If the result of this mediation is a Binding
                    Agreement, it has to be logged with the Archivist.
                2.  Council can object to the use of a particular
                    published canon character by a Coordinator and
                    propose that it not be used for the remainder of the
                    term of that Coordinator should there be significant
                    concern that the published canon character is not
                    being used responsibly.

    <!-- -->

    4.  Nomenclature
        1.  All instances of the racial slur word gypsy are replaced
            with the correct term: Rom, Roma, or Romani. Any bylaw that
            uses the correct terms covers regulation under the former
            term gypsy.
        2.  All instances of the racial slur Kafir/Kaffir/Kuffar - such
            as in the ritual Kafir's Bane shall be changed. For the
            Dur-An-Ki ritual, we are changing the name to Ghaflah Bane.
            Any bylaw or packet that uses a different term for this
            covers regulation under the former term Kafir/Kaffir.

            learned the custom content from the character that created
            it or another character who can accurately trace the
            instruction to the original creator. This is to exclude any
            power or mechanic that is contained within a packet or had
            been in a packet (requiring that Coordinator's Approval).
            Coordinators may, at their discretion, also exclude a power
            from this clause if they have sufficient need to do so and a
            recent packet that would cover the power or mechanic has not

                "teacher" because Dur-An-Ki is learned via ascending the
                ladder of heaven, and is not "taught" by a PC.
            4.  Learning Custom Combination Discipline, Technique, or

                PC "teacher" because Wanga is taught by the Loa, and is
                not "taught" by a pc.

                of the character who is teaching the Custom Content

8.  PCs in service to Coordinator(s) NPC
    1.  PCs may have a Binding Agreement if it is decided by any of the
        parties involved (Coordinator(s), ST(s), or Player(s)) that a
        Binding Agreement is needed for Approval - signed by the player,
        its storytellers and the Coordinator(s) in charge of the NPC
        prior to serving or performing a service for any Coordinator(s)
        Level NPC at a Sect level that is not specific to internal clan
        politics. This Binding Agreement will be logged with the

        5.  An approximation of duties and responsibilities for the PC
        6.  Provisions in case there is a change of ST staff, home
            chronicle or Coordinators
        7.  Stepping down/removal from the position for IC and/or OOC
            reasons
        8.  Rewards for exceptional service or punishment for failure --
            perceived or factual.
        9.  The method each party may trigger an early dissolvement of
            the Binding Agreement if needed and the consequences of such
            early release.

    <!-- -->

    2.  An incoming Coordinator may choose to review all existing
        Binding Agreements under the purview of their office after their
        election period. This review shall take 90 to 120 days (3-4
        months) from the time of their election with an additional 60
        days (2 months) allowed for having changes logged with the
        Archivist's Office.
        1.  Within that time period, the Coordinator may propose a
            revised Binding Agreement to replace the pre-existing
            Binding Agreement.
        2.  If the player and staff agree, the old Binding Agreement is
            replaced with the new one.
        3.  If the player and staff do not agree, the old Binding
            Agreement as written by the previous staff remains
            effective.
        4.  Either side may request mediation to come to a compromise in
            the creation of a new Binding Agreement.
        5.  After reviewing a Binding Agreement, if the Coordinator
            feels that the Agreement is no longer necessary or serving
            its purpose, they may dissolve the Binding Agreement. This
            requires notification of the Archivist, Player, and Player's
            Staff.
        6.  Binding Agreements that need to be created or edited during
            the Coordinator's term also follow this procedure if
            compromise or mediation is required; edits outside of that
            time period are not considered part of the Incoming
            Coordinator Review period.

    <!-- -->

    3.  PCs in service to a Coordinator(s) NPC must include their
        Storytellers and Coordinator(s) of said NPC on all
        communications relating to their service

9.  Vampire Regulations
    1.  Disciplines and Combination Disciplines
        1.  Any out-of-Clan Disciplines must be learned from a vampire
            who possesses that Discipline in-Clan. Exceptions to this
            include:
            1.  Samedi who learn Voudoun Necromancy as per their Clan
                Advantage. This Necromancy is considered to be out-of
                Clan and as such, has the out-of-Clan XP cost and may
                not be taught. Samedi who learn Voudoun Necromancy are
                not considered "Rogue Necromancers" for the purpose of
                rarity approvals.
            2.  Blood Magic which may be learned without a teacher who
                possesses the Blood Magic in-Clan, as deemed appropriate
                by the Coordinator in charge of approval, as per
                Coordinator Bylaws, Section 3.C.ii.6.a.
            3.  Risen may teach Vampire Disciplines under the same rules
                as Vampire the Masquerade character types. For this
                purpose Celerity, Fortitude, Obfuscate, and Potence
                shall be considered "In Clan".

        <!-- -->

        1.  Any methods used to increase the number of In-Clan
            Disciplines a vampire possesses beyond what is published the
            description of the clan or bloodline must select the
            additional Discipline from the following list: Animalism,
            Auspex, Celerity, Dominate, Fortitude, Obfuscate, Potence
            and Presence
            1.  The Baali Apostate and Revenant Discipline Merits do not
                add additional In-Clan Disciplines to a vampire
                character.
            2.  An Inceptor Discipline gained through the Inceptor Merit
                is exempt from this Bylaw.

        <!-- -->

        3.  Caitiff and Pander must declare the three disciplines they
            possess as "in-clan" at creation. Should one of these
            disciplines be a Clan Specific (e.g., Protean, Dementation,
            Quietus), it requires Coordinator Approval of the
            appropriate Clan, as per the Unusual Caitiff/Pander
            guidelines of the Controlled Items section, and cannot
            duplicate any such existing clan.
        4.  Temporis
            1.  Characters possessing both Temporis and Celerity – PC:
                Disallowed – NPC: Disallowed – Coordinator: Brujah
                1.  To include any method of duplicating either
                    discipline regardless of source.

            <!-- -->

            2.  Kairos: A character who changes in play from a "LOtN:R
                Brujah" into a "Kairos Brujah" will convert their
                already purchased levels of Celerity into Temporis on a
                one for one basis.
            3.  Epicene: A character who changes in play from a "LOtN:R
                Brujah" into an "Epicene Brujah" will convert their
                already purchased levels of Celerity into Temporis on a
                one for one basis
            4.  Out of Clan: Any character being taught Temporis out of
                clan receives an immediate refund of all XP spent on
                Celerity to be spent solely on Temporis. XP refunded in
                this manner is halved and rounded down.
                1.  A character requires a teacher for each level of
                    Temporis being converted from Celerity.
                2.  Any unspent XP is lost.

        <!-- -->

        5.  To teach a combination discipline, the teacher must have at
            least one of the prerequisite disciplines in-clan and the
            one being taught must have the requisite disciplines at the
            appropriate level.

    <!-- -->

    2.  Camarilla Regulations
        1.  All Anathema shall be under the joint controlled of the
            Coordinator of the clan offering Trophy and the Camarilla
            Coordinator. All Anathema named to the OWbN Red List shall
            require the name to be put forward by the Camarilla
            Coordinator and the Clan Coordinator whose clan will offer
            Trophy. This is a Genre Proposal as detailed in the
            Coordinators Bylaws section 3.C.iii.
            1.  There are no PC Anathema. If the proposed Anathema is a
                PC, his or her Storyteller must be consulted prior to
                the proposal and his stance on the matter be noted in
                the proposal. If approved, the character becomes an NPC
                under control of the appropriate Coordinator(s).

        <!-- -->

        2.  The reward for slaying an Anathema is a Trophy, which can
            include but is not limited to immunity to Bloodhunts
            (whether extant or future), breaking of a Blood Bond, Rite
            of Progeny, Boons, Monetary Rewards, Grant of Domain,
            Sanctioned Diablerie, Discipline Education, Indulgence
            (forgiveness for past transgressions), Sanctioned Slaying
            (Rite of Destruction over an enemy, granted by the
            appropriate Coordinator NPC), Clan Friendship and the
            individual(s) claiming Trophy usually keeps the Anathema's
            possessions, as well.
            1.  Characters slaying an Anathema may choose to give credit
                to an existing Alastor, in which case they are not given
                Trophy (which includes not becoming an Alastor), though
                they should be rewarded by the Alastor. These rewards
                are similar in nature to the Trophy rewards, but are
                more limited by nature of the individual giving them.
                All rewards, Trophy or otherwise, for the slaying of an
                Anathema will be determined by the appropriate Clan
                Coordinator and the Camarilla Coordinator.

        <!-- -->

        3.  All Alastors shall be under the joint control of the Clan
            Coordinator of the clan they report to and the Camarilla
            Coordinator. Any future exceptions are subject to a Genre
            Proposal as detailed in the Coordinators Bylaws section
            3.C.iii.
            1.  There are no PC Alastors. If the proposed Alastor is a
                PC, his or her Storyteller must be consulted prior to
                the proposal. and his stance on the matter be noted in
                the proposal. If approved, the character becomes an NPC
                under control of the appropriate Coordinator(s).
            2.  An Alastor is named through dedication to the Camarilla
                as determined to be appropriate by the Coordinator
                proposing the addition of the character to the Alastors,
                or claiming to have slain an Anathema (subject to in
                character investigation prior to the proposal).

        <!-- -->

        4.  The appearance of Anathema and Alastors require Genre
            Proposals as detailed in the Coordinators Bylaws section
            3.C.iii.. Should it be part of an ongoing plot, each
            specific instance need not be voted on separately, but must
            be approved by the appropriate Clan Coordinator and the
            Camarilla Coordinator after the plot proposal has passed.

    3.  Sabbat Regulations
        1.  The Ritae of the Sabbat, both Auctoritas and Ignobilis, can
            only be performed by actual members of the Sabbat (i.e.
            those that have undergone Creation Rites). Ritae performed
            by non-Sabbat characters automatically fail. Non-Sabbat
            characters may not mechanically benefit from Ritae, though
            non-Sabbat may still participate in the Vaulderie.

    <!-- -->

    4.  Sabbat Regulations
        1.  Sect Infiltration - PC: Coordinator Notify - NPC: None -
            Coordinator: Varies
            1.  Every vampire PC is required to have a sect listed on
                their character sheet at character creation or changed
                during a sect defection. A character is considered
                infiltrating another sect if they have another identity
                or status in a sect that is not the sect listed on their
                character sheet. If the sect they are infiltrating is
                different from the the sect they were created in as per
                Character Bylaw 2.f, or the sect they have defected to
                as per Character Bylaw 10.m.x.2; then they will fall
                under this bylaw. Coordinator Notify is required to be
                sent to the Sect Coordinator/s the character is
                infiltrating from and to, or the respective Clan
                Coordinator in the case of Independent characters, to be
                allowed to do such.

10. Controlled Items
    1.  Definitions and general rules
        1.  This list is to be considered a binding document for all
            games and coordinators within the network and shall be
            composed of every item that may require Chronicles, Players
            and Coordinators to seek approval or notification before
            entering play.
            1.  Blood Magic Paths and Rituals are not required to be
                part of this document, but should instead be made
                available in specific binding documents regulating their
                permission level. Any changes in their rarities will be
                regulated by the packet and/or its Council Vote.
                1.  Characters may retain paths and rituals that are no
                    longer part of their paradigm due to a regulation
                    change through legacy exemptions
                    1.  Characters seeking to learn out of paradigm
                        paths and rituals may attempt to learn them from
                        characters that have them through the
                        aforementioned legacy exemptions with their
                        rarity to be considered “Coordinator Approval”
                        for requirements.

            <!-- -->

            2.  Changes in categories, additions or removals of items
                listed in this Bylaws are to be considered public
                proposals and as such, may be shared with the player
                base. Such proposals can be submitted by the proper
                genre coordinator, Exec Team or the Archivist Team.
                1.  If those changes further restrict an item, a legacy
                    examption period of 30 days will be granted to
                    register the item following the proper procedure
                    without needing to submit it through a new approval
                    process, unless specifically stated otherwise in the
                    proposal. Should the item not be registered during
                    this period, it will need to face the new approval
                    process. The legacy exemption period begins with the
                    closing of the vote.

        <!-- -->

        2.  Each individual entry has the Controlled Item, what
            regulation level it is for a PC and for an NPC, and a
            listing of the controlling Coordinator. If necessary,
            further definitions will be added.
            1.  Disallowed: Not available for play, even with a Bylaw
                Exception Vote.
            2.  2/3 Majority Vote: Approval requires a 2/3 majority
                Council Vote.
            3.  Majority Vote: Approval requires a simple majority
                Council Vote.
            4.  Coordinator Approval: Approval requires the approval of
                the listed Coordinator(s).
            5.  Coordinator Notify: Approval requires the character be
                notified to the listed Coordinator(s)

    <!-- -->

    2.  Controlled characters and items may be submitted for approval
        and/or vote through the OWbN website
        1.  Every R&U character and item are required to be logged in
            with the Archivists
            1.  Backgrounds/merits/and other ways that represent a
                separate R&U item (Such as a vampire with a R&U NPC
                ghoul) are logged against the character, and not the
                chronicle.

        <!-- -->

        2.  It is the responsibility of the Storyteller to submit the
            R&U registration for characters and items based in their
            chronicle. This power can be delegated to a Council Member.
        3.  It is the responsibility of a Coordinator to submit the R&U
            registration for characters and items belonging to his
            office. This power can be delegated to a sub-coordinator
            with express permission.
        4.  The Archivists may allow the R&U to be submitted through
            e-mail. However, should this happen, it becomes their
            responsibility to submit the R&U to the website.

    <!-- -->

    3.  Registration time frame
        1.  Items that require a Council vote may be submitted by the
            chronicle’s Council Member or the Archivist and, if passed,
            be registered in the database by the Archivist no more than
            10 days after the closing of the vote.
        2.  Items that require Coordinator Approval have to be answered
            by the responsible Coordinator within 14 days of the request
            being sent to the proper e-mail or contact form as defined
            by the Coordinator.
            1.  If the request is not answered at all in this period of
                time, the item will be considered approved. For this to
                happen, the person requesting the item must bump the
                request at least twice during this time frame.
            2.  Should a coordinator need further information to make
                his decision, the period will be reset from the moment
                that the requested information is given.
            3.  If for some reason the Coordinator is not able to make
                this decision within the time frame, an extension can be
                requested to the Executive Team.
            4.  The 14 day period is automatically extended for the
                duration of the below time frames:
                1.  Between the 4th Thursday in November to January 3rd.
                2.  From the beginning of Genre Coordinator Elections
                    until one week after they have concluded.

            <!-- -->

            5.  Any time an item passes via this method, the archivist
                will notify council said action occurred. (Specifics are
                not required, simply \[responsible Coordinator\] had an
                auto-approval processed)

        <!-- -->

        3.  Items that require notification to a Coordinator will be
            fulfilled by submitting the R&U through the website
        4.  Archivists may allow the R&U to be submitted through e-mail.
            However, should this happen, it becomes their responsibility
            to submit the R&U to the website and notify the proper
            coordinators.

    <!-- -->

    4.  Chronicles and coordinators that have characters (PC or NPC) or
        items that are in violation of the Controlled Items Section
        guidelines must bring themselves in compliance within 30 days
        1.  Characters and items that are found in violation of the
            Bylaws are not allowed to enter play until their state of
            non-compliance is solved through any of the methods
            available below
        2.  Should the chosen method of compliance be to remove the R&U
            from play within the aforementioned time frame, any and all
            short and long term gain to PCs and NPCs such as
            disciplines, gifts, merits, or any other similar benefit
            must immediately be removed as well. Stories that involved
            the unregistered R&U need to be changed or retconned to
            reflect the absence of the item or character involved. This
            includes NPCs and items created to supply merits and
            backgrounds that might require it
        3.  Should the chosen method of compliance be to register the
            R&U, the process will be the same as a regular R&U.
        4.  Storytellers and Coordinators that fails to comply with the
            requirements of the Controlled Items Section may be subject
            to Disciplinary Action.
        5.  Players that have lied, cheated or obstructed the truth for
            the purposes of circumventing the Controlled Items may be
            subject to Disciplinary Action and/or the administrative
            death of the character benefited by the misrepresentation.
