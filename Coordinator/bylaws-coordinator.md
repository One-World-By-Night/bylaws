The Bylaws of One World by Night

  

*One World by Night (OWbN) is a network of international Live Action
Role Play (LARP) chronicles. These chronicles are brought together for
the purpose of sharing a broad and colorful story that extends past each
city’s borders. We believe in the sovereignty of each chronicle, so far
as it does not impugn upon the cohesiveness of the organization as a
whole. We further believe that treating each chronicle, and by extension
each player, with respect is the bedrock upon which sound cooperative
Storytelling takes place.*

                1.  The Mediation Coordinators may be sought as a
                    binding arbiter in a disputed between parties with

                        it as they see fit to do so. Additionally,

                    they may recuse themselves and have another
                    Mediation Coordinator take their place. The Head

                    chronicle at which the action is to occur.
                2.  If the action is foreseeable in advance, permission
                    should also be sought from the PC's home chronicle
                    STs for any direct interaction via NPCs.
                    1.  Permission is not required for indirect
                        interaction (wherein the words, requests,
                        desires, etc. of NPCs are carried to PCs by
                        another PC), only for direct interaction
                        (wherein a PC personally interacts with, or is
                        affected personally by, NPCs without the
                        intermediary of other PCs).

                <!-- -->

                3.  If permission is granted, they may take those
                    actions.
                4.  If permission is not granted, the Coordinator may
                    take their case before Council. Council's rulings
                    will be binding to the Coordinator and the
                    chronicle(s) in question.
                5.  If Head Storytellers make agreements with
                    Coordinators concerning PCs, those agreements shall
                    be binding on both the Coordinator and the
                    chronicle, regardless of who holds the Coordinator
                    position or the ST positions (though agreements may
                    be altered if both STs and Coordinators agree).
                    1.  Should a formal binding agreement be made
                        between the Coordinator and another party (such
                        as a player and their Storyteller, a Chronicle,
                        or another Coordinator), that formal binding
                        agreement shall be logged with the Archivist and
                        reported to the Executive Team for the purposes
                        of documentation should dispute occur. Any
                        changes to said formal binding agreement shall
                        likewise be logged with the Archivist and
                        reported to the Executive Team.

                <!-- -->

                6.  Failure to keep such agreements shall be brought
                    before Council and considered appropriate grounds
                    for punitive measures.

            <!-- -->

            4.  They may advise Coordinators and STs on ways to leverage
                R&U related backgrounds and plotlines on a global level,
                if desired.
                1.  For example: in the Midwest, it’s quite possible
                    that various PCs in Kenosha, Milwaukee and Green Bay
                    all have a 5-pt. Mentor who is a Samedi. Instead of
                    having 3-5 7th generation Samedi, it would make
                    sense for the various Mentors to be combined into a
                    single NPC, and used as a plot device at ST
                    discretion.

                Sub-Coordinators, who they will hold responsibility
                over.
                1.  They may remove these Sub-Coordinators at will, and
                    Council may remove these Sub-Coordinators with a
                    majority vote.
                2.  Coordinators are responsible for all disputed issues
                    that are brought before Council.

                        Coordinator may make any edits they feel are

                Magic for which they are responsible
                1.  Each Document shall serve as a catalog of all Paths

                    paradigm

                    custom content in this catalog, but all custom
                    content included should be labeled clearly as such

        3.  Genre Coordinators must pass before Council any plot, R&U
            bylaw revision, R&U named characters, Coordinator-NPC
            Character Resurrections, territory requests, in character
            enforced policy, or in character binding edict they wish to
            use which they can reasonably expect to affect multiple
            chronicles and these proposals need not be seconded, but go
            immediately into discussion.
            1.  If no opposition is voiced during the week of
                discussion, the proposal is considered passed and
                enforceable. Once passed these are considered binding to
                all chronicles and a chronicles refusal to adhere is
                grounds for OWBN disciplinary measures. Opposition must
                be in regards to the content of the proposal and must
                give those reasons why the objection is voiced. This is
                to allow Coordinator's the opportunity to respond and/or
                make changes/remove the proposal and its contents.
                1.  Objection to a Proposal
                    1.  A Council member, the HC, or an AHC may object
                        to the proposal at any time of the Autopass
                        Discussion window. This objection removes the
                        proposal's ability to autopass and must instead
                        proceed to Vote.
                        1.  To object to a proposal, post with
                            "\[OBJECTION\]\[PROPOSAL\] Proposal name" in
                            the subject line of the message, where
                            "proposal name" is the title of the draft
                            proposal, while also removing the
                            "\[AUTOPASS\]" from the subject line.
                        2.  In the body of the message, include the
                            statement "I \[name\] of \[Chronicle Name\]
                            object to this proposal" followed by the
                            reasoning behind the objection.
                        3.  Opposition must be in regard to the content
                            of the proposal.
                            1.  This opposition must have some degree of
                                detail to it, e.g. in the case of legacy
                                exemption, a further reason must be
                                given beyond the status of a legacy
                                exemption / no legacy exemption clause
                                in the prop itself.
                            2.  Exec is considered to be the final
                                arbiter on what is or is not a detailed
                                enough reason to object to a prop.

                    information, such as but not limited to PC's holding
                    regional positions or PC's important enough to have

                    specific information change during the duration that
                    the document is current. Adding or removing player
                    characters and their respective information from
                    genre documents is expressly NOT covered by this
                    clause, and should be handled through the normal
                    council approval processes.

            2.  Those that seem to affect only one chronicle only need
                local ST approval. In this case, conflicts with the
                chronicle are subject to point three above.
            3.  Coordinators may bring before Council any dispute
                between themselves and another Coordinator or ST in
                which they feel OWBN wide consistency or global genre is
                at stake, and Council shall make a timely investigation
                and judgment.
            4.  Passing new R&U Named characters before council is to be
                treated as something which affects multiple chronicles.
            5.  Coordinators may lay claim to territories in order to
                preserve or uphold the status quo established by the
                canon material, or due to Council-approved plot-lines or
                other such world-events
                1.  Claiming new or modifying existing territories is
                    considered something that affects multiple
                    Chronicles and must be brought to the OWbN Council
                    independent of other proposals.
                    1.  Coordinators may propose sole control of a
                        territory, or joint control with other
                        Coordinators, specified in the proposal.
                    2.  After a territory claim has passed a vote of the
                        OWbN Council, the territory will be added to the
                        Territory List posted on the OWbN website.

                <!-- -->

                2.  Each claim must include the proposed levels of
                    restriction for each category of the territory.
                    1.  These categories are as follows:
                        1.  Character backgrounds / back-stories:
                            Approval, Notify, or None.
                        2.  Use in Game-play: Approval, Notify, or None.

                <!-- -->

                3.  These categories may be further specified, if
                    desired, by creature type (for example: Vampires,
                    Mages, Changing Breeds, Wraith) and/or Sect.
                4.  The level of restriction for at least one of these
                    categories (either Backgrounds or Game-play) must be
                    Coordinator Notification or Coordinator Approval; a
                    Coordinator may not lay claim to a territory which
                    has "None" specified for both character backgrounds
                    and game-play. Such areas are covered in the
                    AdministrativeBylaws, Section 1.B.iii.

            <!-- -->

            6.  Any Proposal that utilizes Justicar NPC(s) for the
                purposes of enforcing genre policy over the Organization
                requires the consent of the Camarilla Coordinator and
                the Genre Coordinator that controls the Justicar NPC in
                question. Council may not utilize the Justicar NPCs to
                Propose a Genre Proposal without this consent.

        4.  Abuses of the limits of these powers may be addressed with
            local strikes or brought before Council and considered
            appropriate grounds for punitive measures. This applies to
            both Coordinators and their staff, and chronicles and their
            ST’s.

        matters which have been brought IC to the Justicar's attention)
        which are described at the beginning of each census request,
