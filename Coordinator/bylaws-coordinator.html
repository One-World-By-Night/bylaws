  <i
    >One World by Night (OWbN) is a network of international Live Action Role
    Play (LARP) chronicles. These chronicles are brought together for the
    purpose of sharing a broad and colorful story that extends past each
    city&rsquo;s borders. We believe in the sovereignty of each chronicle, so
    far as it does not impugn upon the cohesiveness of the organization as a
    whole. We further believe that treating each chronicle, and by extension
    each player, with respect is the bedrock upon which sound cooperative
    Storytelling takes place.</i
