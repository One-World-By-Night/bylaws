The Bylaws of One World by Night

  

*One World by Night (OWbN) is a network of international Live Action
Role Play (LARP) chronicles. These chronicles are brought together for
the purpose of sharing a broad and colorful story that extends past each
city's borders. We believe in the sovereignty of each chronicle, so far
as it does not impugn upon the cohesiveness of the organization as a
whole. We further believe that treating each chronicle, and by extension
each player, with respect is the bedrock upon which sound cooperative
Storytelling takes place.*

1.  Chronicles
    1.  What is a Chronicle?
        1.  A chronicle is a geographically localized body of players,
            including STs and a Council Member. The Council Member is
            assumed to represent the will of the chronicle to OWbN,
            however the Council Member is not assumed to have the
            ownership of the chronicle, which is assumed to belong to
            the body of players as a whole, including the STs and
            Council Member. Players may also be members of multiple
            chronicles.

    2.  Chronicle Boundaries and Control
        1.  Chronicles have full control over the events inside of their
            boundaries. These boundaries are registered with the
            Membership Coordinator, but should be well known to
            surrounding chronicles. Storytellers wishing to run scenes
            in another chronicles boundaries must first obtain
            permission from a Storyteller from that chronicle. A
            chronicle may only claim territory that is considered a
            reasonable distance from its IC location.
        2.  Territorial disputes may be taken to the executive team for
            mediation.
        3.  When a chronicle runs scenes outside their territory, in any
            capacity, they may not draw significant public attention nor
            create events that would affect other chronicles. They may
            not create actions that would damage or alter the
            political/social landscape of the area or that would cause
            the area to deviate from the "status quo".

    <!-- -->

    3.  Retcon
        1.  Frequently characters interact with other characters not
            only in their own game, but due to travel and internet
            mediums also in other chronicles. There are times in which
            certain aspects need to be removed from the continuity of
            the overall story of OWbN. A "retcon" is defined as removing
            a specific thing from the continuity of OWbN Story. This
            "thing" can be as simple as a single spoken word by a
            (non)player character, to more complicated things such as
            role-play scenes (either in person, or online mediums),
            combats, or following the specific rules outlined in
            Character Bylaws - even character death. When an item is
            retconned, that item is removed from play as if that item
            never existed, and the greater world at large, as well as
            (non)player-characters will react equally as if the item
            never existed.
            1.  Retconning may only be performed by an HST of a OWbN
                Chronicle.
            2.  Retconning must be submitted to the relevant parties
                within 6 months from the original events taking place.
            3.  Retconning that happen which have any potential to have
                had information of the item in question, must be
                submitted to the OWbN Storyteller list to ensure all
                chronicles are aware of the retcon and can attempt to
                reinforce the change to continuity of OWbN's overall
                story.
            4.  Retconning of items which erase continuity for
                characters with a current or former Binding Agreement,
                must be mediated with the Coordinator who held the
                Binding agreement.
                1.  Mediation may include exec at the request of either
                    the HST or the Coordinator in question.
                2.  This is meant to ensure that any changes in
                    continuity while the character holds the binding
                    agreement is changed and upheld in a consistent way
                    the Coordinator is both able and has the power to
                    enforce.

            <!-- -->

            5.  Retconning which need to occur beyond 6 months from the
                original events taking place must be submitted to
                council for private vote.
                1.  These proposals go immediately into discussion and
                    do not require a second.
                2.  Any and all information regarding the item of the
                    proposal's discussion is temporarily embargoed until
                    the results of the proposal conclude.
                    1.  To facilitate this, knowledge of this private
                        proposal may specifically be shared with any
                        storyteller as well as communicated on the OWbN
                        Storyteller communication list.
                    2.  These proposals may be granted General
                        Consensus, however it must be requested by an
                        eligible voting Council Member, different from
                        the proposing Chronicle.

    4.  Plot
        1.  Chronicles may not direct STs or players that events in
            other chronicles did not happen in their local chronicle
            continuity. Events in OWbN chronicles are part of the OWbN
            continuity, and must be accepted as valid IC events for all
            OWbN, unless retconned by the originating STs or Council.
            Chronicles may, however, lessen or change any effects that
            outside events might have on their local chronicle as long
            as these changes do not fundamentally alter or end the plot.
            This does not apply to OWBN Council approved plot, which
            must be run as passed.
        2.  Content
            1.  Definitions
                1.  The players of OWBN acknowledge that the World of
                    Darkness is a mature game that involves themes aimed
                    at an adult audience
                    1.  The players of OWBN acknowledge that this
                        content includes themes of a sexual nature, both
                        consensual and non-consensual in nature.
                    2.  The players of OWBN acknowledge that while
                        non-consensual interactions are an aspect of the
                        World of Darkness that cannot be completely
                        ignored, Out of Character Affirmative Consent
                        lines in regards to engaging these topics should
                        not be crossed.

            <!-- -->

            2.  Consent
                1.  The players of OWBN acknowledge the definition of
                    Affirmative Consent as follows:
                    1.  Affirmative consent is a knowing, voluntary and
                        mutual decision among all participants to engage
                        in any activity.
                        1.  Consent can be given by words or actions, as
                            long as those words or actions create clear
                            permission regarding willingness to engage
                            in the designated sexual activity.
                        2.  Silence or lack of resistance, in and of
                            itself, does not demonstrate consent.
                        3.  The definition of consent does not vary
                            based upon a participant's sexual
                            orientation, gender identity, or gender
                            expression.

                    <!-- -->

                    2.  Consent may be withdrawn at any time.

            <!-- -->

            3.  Sexual Encounter Plot/Scenes
                1.  Sexual interactions of any IC nature require the
                    written OOC consent of all parties involved,
                    including Volunteers (Storytellers, Coordinators,
                    Subcoordinators) if NPCs are involved.
                    1.  Sexual Violence as active RP, active plots,
                        scenes or descriptions is disallowed, even with
                        consent. This includes both player to player and
                        volunteer to player scenes and/or plot. While
                        Sexual Violence can be part of a background plot
                        or background for characters (both NPC and PC),
                        this topic cannot be run as a current plot or
                        scenes run either in an online medium or at live
                        games.
                        1.  For the purpose of this bylaw, Sexual
                            Violence is defined by the United Nations
                            Definition of Sexual Violence which is as
                            follows:
                            1.  Sexual violence is a form of
                                gender-based violence and encompasses
                                any sexual act, attempt to obtain a
                                sexual act, unwanted explicit sexual
                                comments or advances, or acts to
                                traffic, or otherwise directed against a
                                person’s sexuality using coercion, by
                                any person regardless of their
                                relationship to the victim, in any
                                setting. Sexual violence takes multiple
                                forms and includes rape, sexual abuse,
                                forced pregnancy, forced sterilization,
                                forced abortion, forced prostitution,
                                trafficking, sexual enslavement, forced
                                circumcision, castration, genital
                                mutilation, and forced nudity.
                            2.  Sexual Violence as defined by this bylaw
                                does NOT include:
                                1.  Acts that some
                                    Countries/Regions/States have
                                    created laws against to target
                                    minority groups (such as laws that
                                    target the LGBTQA+ community) nor
                                    does it include flirting, dating, or
                                    other normative relationship
                                    behaviors.
                                2.  Acts that would fall under the
                                    overarching umbrella of the
                                    BDSM/kink community. Provided that
                                    consent is obtained for these types
                                    of relationships and the
                                    interactions therein, they are
                                    permitted for interpersonal RP.

                            3.  Sexual violence in Background Story for
                                PCs/NPCS:
                                1.  While sexual violence can be known
                                    to exist in the World of Darkness
                                    and may be part of the backgrounds
                                    of characters (PC and NPCs), and
                                    graphic notation of this background
                                    must be clearly and explicitly
                                    labeled as such. Use of all PCs or
                                    NPCs for such backstory must be
                                    agreed to in writing by the related
                                    Player or ST staff who controls the
                                    character or approves the background
                                    in the case of player-created NPCs
                                    for the purpose of backstory.

                    <!-- -->

                    2.  Characters (NPC or PC) under the age of 18 may
                        not be actively RP’d in sexual scenes or in a
                        sexual manner. (this number is determined by the
                        age of consent of Canada, wherein OWBN is based
                        as a nonprofit organization.)
                        1.  As it applies to non-human characters who
                            can shift into human creatures in the
                            Changing Breeds genre, age of maturity
                            (meaning the PC is able to shift into a
                            human form that is 18+ years of age) is
                            determined to be as follows:
                            1.  3 years of age for Lupus, Feline,
                                Corvid, Ursine, Suchid and Hyaenid born
                                PCs
                            2.  2 years of age for Latrani, Vasuki, and
                                Arachnid

                2.  This OOC consent must be obtained before any scenes
                    of this nature, regardless of their IC consensual /
                    non-consensual nature, can be run.
                    1.  Volunteers running scenes with sexual content:
                        1.  Consent given to Volunteers by players for
                            sexual content does not carry from one scene
                            to another and must specifically agree to
                            prior to the scene by all parties involved,
                            every time.
                        2.  Before executing a scene where consent is
                            required, the volunteer running the scene
                            must first state or otherwise tag the reason
                            for requiring consent.

                        those players who witness events played out in
                        live games, regardless if their PC is directly
                        involved.
                        1.  All chronicles must have guidelines for
                            physical RP, touching, etc that is allowed
                            during live play, as well as types of scenes
                            allowed during in-person game play posted
                            clearly in the House Rules. Sexual RP cannot
                            be conducted at live games without prior ST
                            permission, and in the manner allowed by

                            encounter does not happen, or the PC was not
                            in the scene when sexual content occurred -
                            however, all non sexual elements of the
                            scene remain)

            4.  Pregnancy/Parenthood Plot/Scenes
                1.  Pregnancy or parenthood of any nature requires the
                    written OOC consent of all parties involved,
                    including the STs if NPCs are involved.
                    1.  All players, regardless of their PC’s gender,
                        are protected by this clause.
                    2.  A character may not become pregnant without this
                        written consent, regardless of genre.

                1.  Complications and Termination
                    1.  Any IC complications to the pregnancy must be
                        agreed upon by all parties.
                    2.  If any party involved in the pregnancy wishes to
                        opt out of the pregnancy story-line, it does not
                        require the consent of both parties.
                        1.  In the case that one party wishes to
                            continue the pregnancy, a retcon of the
                            'other parent' to an NPC is permitted.
                        2.  A pregnancy may never be transferred to
                            another PC.

            <!-- -->

            5.  Circumventions
                1.  These restrictions may not be circumvented by any
                    gift, power, art, item, arcanoi, discipline or other
                    effect regardless of its source or text.

    5.  Denying Entry
        1.  The Storytellers of individual Chronicles have the right to
            ban any player from their game.
            1.  Any player banned from a chronicle must be announced on
                the OWBN-ST and OWBN-Council lists, and the player
                should be notified, if possible.
            2.  If the ban is the result of a chronicle disciplinary
                action, the disciplinary action shall be submitted
                separately as per Section 8.D.iii.5.

        <!-- -->

        2.  The Storytellers of individual Chronicles have the right to

            cards, or take other actions to be allowed entry into the
            Chronicle.
        3.  The Storytellers of individual Chronicles have the right to
            deny a character entry into game-play. When doing so, the
            Storytellers should clearly communicate the reason the entry

    <!-- -->

    6.  House Rules
        1.  The Storytellers of each Chronicle have the right to craft a
            set of house rules.
            1.  They should primarily clarify or re-interpret the core
                rules books for the applicable genre(s) for their
                Chronicle.
            2.  They may also be used to define or set the style of play
                within the game.
            3.  They may not contradict the OWBN specific rules as
                specified in the bylaws or genre packets.
            4.  They may clarify or re-interpret the OWBN specific rules
                to make them more restrictive than stated in the bylaws
                or genre packets.

    <!-- -->

    7.  Following the Bylaws
        1.  All members of OWBN are responsible for adhering to the OWBN
            Bylaws, Genre Guidelines, Rules and Regulations. However
            when related to chronicles, the Storytellers and Council
            Members will be responsible for the actions of their
            Chronicles.
        2.  All votes passed by Council are considered binding. It is
            the duty of the Council Member to inform their Storytellers
            and players of any and all revisions to the bylaws, genre
            documents, rules, and regulations.
            1.  Bylaw changes must be updated on the website. This is
                the responsibility of the Web Team.
            2.  Genre Documents that have been passed by Council will be
                stored on the website. Council Members and Storytellers
                can access these documents through their log-in to the
                OWBN Website.

    <!-- -->

    8.  Discipline
        1.  Chronicle discipline is the province of the Chronicle Staff;
            however disciplinary actions passed by Council must be
            enforced by the Chronicle Staff.
        2.  Every chronicle must have a written disciplinary policy.
            These policies must be made available either on the
            chronicles' website or at the check-in desk.
        3.  Reporting of Chronicle Disciplinary Actions shall be done as
            per Section 8.D.iii.5.

    <!-- -->

    9.  Withdrawal and Expulsion
        1.  A full-member chronicle may always voluntarily withdraw from
            OWBN.
            1.  If it is the will of a substantial group of players to
                continue to play in our Organization, a new Storytelling
                crew may continue and the chronicle will remain in the
                Organization with its current membership status.
                1.  In order to be eligible to retain their current
                    chronicle membership status in the Organization,
                    they will need to submit a full chronicle report as
                    per Administrative Bylaw 8.D.iii to the Archivist
                    and the Executive Team within one month of the
                    withdrawal under 1.I.i.b.
                2.  If a chronicle is under investigation by the
                    Executive Team for expulsion or other disciplinary
                    measures against the chronicle, or if Council is
                    conducting a formal vote which would affect the
                    status of the chronicle's membership, Bylaw 1.I.i.a
                    does not apply.

        <!-- -->

        2.  When a chronicles is expelled or withdraws from OWBN,
            players from that chronicle may transfer their characters to
            other active chronicles, if their transfer is accepted by
            another active chronicle.
            1.  If the chronicle was expelled, any transfers of
                characters will need to involve the Executive Team as
                oversight to ensure that the characters being
                transferred are not party to the reasons for the
                chronicle's expulsion.
            2.  Voluntarily withdrawing from OWBN is effective
                immediately upon notification to the Membership
                Coordinator by the Head Storyteller. The Membership
                Coordinator shall then commence an Exit Interview
                detailing the reasons the game has decided to leave,
                which shall be published to Council and ST lists upon
                full resolution of all necessary transfers and territory
                allocations and should be concluded in no longer than 3
                months time. For this time period, the Game will be
                considered on Probation for all matters with the
                exception that Players have 3 months to transfer out
                characters to another game. Any R&U transfers must be be
                logged with the Archivist by email and or the website
                R&U functions.

2.  Council
    1.  The Council of One World by Night is considered the governing
        body of the network and shall consist of:
        1.  One (1) voting representative from each full member
            chronicle. A voting representative may serve as a voting
            representative for only one full member chronicle at a time.
        2.  The Head Coordinator and Assistant Head Coordinators who
            shall hold one (1) vote each. They may not hold any other
            votes on the Council, such as being the Council
            representative of a chronicle.
            1.  The votes able to be cast by the Executive Team (Head
                Coordinator and Assistant Head Coordinators) is expected
                to be used in the capacity of their administrative
                duties. Reference Administrative Bylaw 4.B.viii for
                limitations to this during the Coordinator Election
                Process.

3.  Proposals and Voting Procedures
    1.  Proposals
        1.  Submission
            1.  Only voting members may submit proposals to the Council
                (unless otherwise noted in subsequent bylaws).
            2.  Include in the subject line of the email "\[PROPOSAL\]"
                and a short description of the proposal.
            3.  The email must include the name of the person making the
                proposal and the chronicle they represent. The message
                body must contain the detailed proposal and how it
                should be integrated into existing bylaws, if passed.

        <!-- -->

        2.  Discussion
            1.  Discussion on said \[PROPOSAL\] shall begin immediately
                and last for at least a week and the proposal shall be
                posted on the voting page for record keeping. This week
                is considered the discussion period.
            2.  To suggest a formal change to the proposal, in the
                subject of the message include \[AMENDMENT\] and in the
                body of the message include the description of what is
                suggested. Any Amended proposal is considered
                \[Withdrawn\] and Proposed again with the changes
                included.
            3.  The original author of the \[PROPOSAL\] may accept or
                reject amendments at their own discretion.
            4.  Any official amendment to the proposal resets the
                discussion week allowing for an additional seven days
                for any objection or second to be applied. The
                \[PROPOSAL\] must also be updated on the website by a
                member of the Executive Team.
            5.  If requested, the Head Coordinator can extend the
                discussion period on a proposal up to 7 days.

        <!-- -->

        3.  Second to the Proposal
            1.  A Council member, the HC, or an AHC must second the
                proposal before it can proceed to a vote.
                1.  To second a proposal, reply to the original proposal
                    and edit the subject line. Remove the “Re:” from the
                    subject and add \[SECOND\]. In the body of the
                    message, include the statement, “I/We/Chronicle Name
                    second(s) this proposal.”
                2.  A proposal that fails to gain a second within one
                    week of the end of the discussion period is
                    considered to have failed and is removed from the
                    voting system.

        <!-- -->

        4.  Sneaking in under the gun
            1.  If a proposal to add or change Administrative,
                Coordinator, or Character Bylaws are made, nothing which
                would fall under such an addition or change may be
                created or approved until after such a proposal's
                closure or withdrawal.
            2.  Should a formal Proposal be made to Council and active,
                subsequent Proposals made to Council and related to the
                current active Proposal shall be delayed, and queued in
                order of their being made.
                1.  The next related proposal in the queue shall become
                    active and open for it's discussion period after the
                    closure, or withdrawal, of the current active
                    Proposal or Proposals discussion period and vote.
                2.  The proposer or proposers of currently active
                    related proposals may choose to forgo this delay for
                    the next delayed related proposal, at any time while
                    their proposal is active. They may not skip delayed
                    proposals in the queue.
                3.  All such proposers must chose to forgo the delay for
                    another proposal to become active. If only one
                    proposer of related proposals exists, it shall be
                    assumed that they choose to forgo the delay, unless
                    they state otherwise.

        <!-- -->

        5.  Administrative Bylaw Changes
            1.  Administrative Coordinators may pass before Council any
                changes to the administrative bylaws, as long as said
                changes directly affect their position. These proposals
                need not be seconded, but go immediately into
                discussion.
                1.  If no opposition is voiced during the week of
                    discussion, the bylaw is considered passed and
                    enforceable. Once passed these bylaws are considered
                    binding to all chronicles (as with any other bylaw)
                    and a chronicles refusal to adhere to said bylaw is
                    grounds for OWBN disciplinary measures. Opposition
                    must be in regards to the content of the proposal
                    and must give those reasons why the objection is
                    voiced. This is to allow Coordinator's the
                    opportunity to respond and/or make changes/remove
                    the proposal and its contents.

        <!-- -->

        6.  Uniform standard
            1.  Any item that requires greater than a majority vote may
                not be bypassed with a simple majority vote. This
                applies to, but is not limited to, the following:
                1.  Exception votes require a 2/3 majority of council in
                    order to pass, and are used only to propose
                    something that is not currently allowed by the
                    bylaws.
                2.  Admissions votes. This ensures that a game entering
                    OWBN cannot enter with a Very Rare R&U PC with a
                    simple majority vote.

            <!-- -->

            2.  Such votes may proceed, but are automatically held to
                the higher standard. For example, if a chronicle wishes
                to enter OWBN with a Very Rare PC, their admissions vote
                requires a 2/3 majority rather than a simple majority.
            3.  When feasible, it is permissible to break any item
                requiring a supermajority into a separate vote. For
                example, an apply game with a Very Rare R&U PC may be
                presented as two proposals - one for basic admission,
                which would require a simple majority, and one for the
                admission of the Very Rare PC, which would require the
                standard 2/3 majority of a Very Rare R&U vote. Failure
                of the secondary vote blocks only the Very Rare PC from
                entering play, not the rest of the chronicle.
            4.  Abstention votes are not taken into consideration when
                determining the voting percentages.

    <!-- -->

    2.  Voting
        1.  Formatting
            1.  A call for voting is posted to the Council with the
                changes and options to the proposal included.
            2.  All options presented in the proposal shall be made
                available to the Council at time of voting.
            3.  All votes must include "Abstain" and an option to reject
                the proposal.
            4.  If it is possible for more than one option to be
                acceptable this must be stated in the proposal.
            5.  Council members are required to use the online Vote
                Management System found at the official One World by
                Night website when casting votes. Votes not cast using
                the official voting system shall not be counted as they
                cannot be revised in the formal Voting Archives
                otherwise.

        <!-- -->

        2.  Timeframe
            1.  Proposals shall have a voting period of one week from
                the completion of the discussion period unless otherwise
                noted in subsequent bylaws.
                1.  No amendments may be made to a proposal that is in
                    the voting timeframe.
            2.  The Head Coordinator may extend any vote by
                twenty-four (24) hour increments or multiples thereof by
                informing Council no later than twenty-four (24) hours
                before the extension. Extensions may not exceed a total
                timeframe of fourteen (14) additional days without a
                mandate from the Council.
            3.  The Head Coordinator or Assistant Head Coordinator may
                close the vote prior to the official date if the outcome
                is a mathematical certainty.
            4.  After the closing date for voting, the votes are counted
                and posted. The Web Team is responsible to update the
                OWBN website to reflect any changes made to the bylaws,
                adding Packets to our resource page, and updating any
                other changes ratified by Council.

        <!-- -->

        3.  Vote Archiving of Autopass Votes
            1.  Any votes that qualify for an Autopass closing must be
                entered into the voting system. The vote option shall
                then simply be "Autopass", which will receive the most
                votes (1, by the authorized individual closing the
                vote), and then be closed.
                1.  Votes to be archived and closed in this manner
                    include, but are not limited to: Coordinator Genre
                    Proposals, Administrative Proposals, Chronicle
                    Admission Proposals, and General Consensus
                    Proposals.

    <!-- -->

    3.  Voting Regulations and Systems
        1.  Resolutions before the Council pass if they receive a
            majority of votes cast, unless otherwise noted in the
            bylaws.
        2.  For proposals with more than two options (including
            Abstain), the outcome may be determined using one or more of
            the following ranked voting methods:
            1.  Condorcet
            2.  Instant-Runoff

        <!-- -->

        3.  The Head Coordinator can change the Quorum definition for
            any vote on a case-by-case basis.

    <!-- -->

    4.  Player Base Notification
        1.  All public votes are available for review by players on the

            players through any means they choose, including social
            media, email or in-person announcements.
        4.  The Head Coordinator has final authority over whether a
            proposal is considered public or private. If they feel it is
            necessary, the Head Coordinator can call for an immediate
            vote by Council to determine whether a proposal is public or
            private. Said proposal will be placed on hold until the
            Council vote on its nature is concluded.
        5.  Should any private proposal include changes to the bylaws,
            changes to R&U classifications, bylaw exemptions, or other
            information that is publicly shareable, it must include a
            Summary Sheet. The Summary Sheet will only detail any
            information that may be shared with the player base – only
            this Summary may be shared with the player base.

    <!-- -->

    5.  General Consensus Vote and Autopass Procedure
        1.  The Head Storyteller of a game, its Council Representative,
            or any Coordinator may petition the Executive Team for a
            General Consensus Vote on an issue that has little impact or
            significance on the organization as a whole but would
            technically require a vote per the bylaws.
        2.  The Executive Team may then choose to perform the following:
            1.  Propose the item on behalf of the Chronicle or
                Coordinator as a \[General Consensus Vote\] to Council.
            2.  Within 48 hours of the original proposal, the Executive
                Team may amend a current proposal on behalf of the
                original author to a \[General Consensus Vote\] to
                Council.

        <!-- -->

        3.  If the \[General Consensus Vote\] is not objected to in
            the (1) one week timeframe of the normal discussion period,
            then the issue is considered to autopass as a Coordinator
            Proposal and be logged into the voting log system. If a
            designated Council Representative formally Objects to the
            item, then it shall go to vote normally.

<!-- -->

4.  Coordinator Elections

            OWbN website.
            1.  The Head Coordinator is required to nominate all
                applicants whom are not disqualified due to
                orginzational disciplinary actions which would preclude
                them from a coordinator position.

        <!-- -->

        3.  Should only one person submit an application for a given
            position, then the Head Coordinator may nominate that one
            applicant without a second applicant on the same ballot or
            extend the time for collecting applications as the Head
            Coordinator sees fit.
        4.  The Ballot will be presented to Council three (3) days
            before the voting period begins for discussion, but no later
            than February 25th without a ratified proposal granting the
            Head Coordinator an extension.
        5.  The Ballot will be posted on the Council, ST, and OWBN-OOC
            mailing lists at the beginning of the vote discussion
            period.
        6.  The vote will open on the day after the seven (7) day
            council discussion period, and close no earlier than the

                and oversees the council thread for all Coordinator
                Office’s questions. No other threads on council, in
                regards to elections, may be created during elections
                but the aforementioned.

        <!-- -->

        7.  All candidates for Elected Coordinator Positions will be
            added to Council for the seven (7) days of discussion and
            seven (7) days of voting to answer questions and explain
            their platforms. Those not elected shall be removed once the
            voting period is done.
        8.  The nominee carrying the most votes on Council shall become
            Coordinator and shall remain in office for a period of
            two (2) years.
            1.  In case of a tie, the Head Coordinator may either break
                the tie or hold a run-off election between all tied
                parties.
                1.  The Executive Team - to include the HC and the
                    AHCs - may not cast their votes for any candidates
                    during this election process. The only exception to
                    this shall be that the HC will retain their vote if
                    they need to break a tie once the vote has
                    concluded, as per the above Bylaw.

            <!-- -->

            2.  For a run-off election, only the candidates who were
                tied will be on the ballot. The option to reject all
                candidates will be removed. The option to abstain will
                remain.
            3.  If the election is still tied after the run-off vote,
                the HC will break the tie.

        <!-- -->

        10. Coordinators will serve beginning two weeks after the
            election vote for their election closes, including any
            run-off election that may have taken place. The current
            Coordinator will be expected to brief the Coordinator-elect
            during these two weeks on issues and events relating to the
            particular Coordinator position being assumed by the
            Coordinator-elect, as well as transfer any necessary
            documents and historical accounts. This includes (but is not
            limited to) any email accounts, binding agreements, and
            electronic mediums that may have been used in an official
            capacity. For example: Google Forms, Facebook, Gmail,
            etcetera ad nauseam.
        11. No proposals may be made or ratified to council once the
            Election Term's ballot is presented to Council (as
            determined by Administrative Bylaws 4.B.IV) until the time
            all elections end. This includes but is not limited to:
            Elections, Election Process, voting procedure(s), Bylaw
            Change(s), Plot(s) or Packet(s). This specifically excludes
            Disciplinary Action Proposal(s) and Head Coordinator
            Emergency Action Proposal(s).
        12. The Assistant Head Coordinator and Second Assistant Head
            Coordinator positions shall be treated as the same position
            for application andelection purposes, with the nominees
            carrying the highest and second highest number of votes
            becoming Coordinator. This vote shall have multiple
            acceptable options equivalent to the number of AHC positions
            available. Thus each Chronicle will receive a number of
            votes equal to the number of positions available.

    <!-- -->

    3.  Special Elections
        1.  Should any Coordinator position become unfilled during a
            term, a special election must be held.
        2.  The Head Coordinator may appoint someone to fill the
            position until the special election is completed.
        3.  The appointee will be treated as an Elected Coordinator,
            except that the appointee will only serve until the Special
            Election is complete.
        4.  The Head Coordinator will announce the Special Election on
            the Council, ST, and OWBN-OOC mailing lists and will accept
            applications for seven (7) days.
        5.  The vote will then proceed following the bylaws in
            Administrative Bylaws 4.B
        6.  Should the position become vacant within one (1) month of
            the Head Coordinator Election, an appointee may serve until
            elections are complete.

    <!-- -->

    4.  Election Procedures
        1.  All election votes will be blind, meaning that no one may
            see how a chronicle voted or any comments they have made
            until the voting period closes. All that will be shown until
            the voting period closes is which game has voted.
        2.  Comments from voting chronicles will also be disabled at the
            time to ensure anonymity for election votes only.
        3.  The HST of a chronicle will be able to see how their CM has
            voted, but not the whole vote itself, simply how their
            chronicle has voted in an election.
        4.  In any coordinator election where there are 3 or more
            candidates, a ranked voting system / instant-runoff voting
            shall be used.

<!-- -->

5.  Finances
    1.  Statement of Responsibility
        1.  The Finance Coordinator, on behalf of the network, shall
            collect all dues and donations. Fees associated with the
            maintenance of Paypal and Bank accounts shall be paid from
            OWBN funds.

    <!-- -->

    2.  Account requirements
        1.  The Financial Coordinator shall maintain the PayPal account
            under finance@OWbN.net for the chronicles to send donations,
            and the payment of server fees.
        2.  The Finance Coordinator shall also establish one or more
            bank accounts for the sole purpose of holding OWBN funds.
            1.  Fees associated with the maintenance of the PayPal and
                Bank accounts shall be paid from OWBN funds.
            2.  The Financial Coordinator will include copies of
                receipts for transactions and bank statements in their
                yearly report.

        <!-- -->

        3.  PayPal is the preferred method of payment for chronicle
            donations. Cash, cheques, credit card payments and money
            orders are acceptable as well.
            1.  If a cheque is returned for any reason the financial
                coordinator will charge the defaulting chronicle an
                additional fee equal to the bank accounts fee for any
                dishonored cheques.

    <!-- -->

    3.  Dues and Allocation
        1.  Dues shall be set at \$20 USD per chronicle per year, and
            \$20 USD per satellite chronicle per year. Dues will first
            be set aside for the yearly OWBN server and banking/paypal
            costs. Dues must be paid by January 31st of each calendar
            year.
            1.  Probationary chronicles are not required to pay dues if
                they are in their admissions process.
                1.  When a chronicle becomes a full member of One World
                    By Night, they are required to pay dues starting the
                    subsequent calendar year.
                2.  Chronicles placed on probation after already having
                    achieved full membership in OWBN are still required
                    to pay dues.

            <!-- -->

            2.  Altering overall dues requires a 2/3 majority vote.
            3.  Council can discount dues for a single given chronicle
                due to extraordinary circumstances, international
                exchange difficulties, or similar reasons with a simple
                majority vote.
            4.  If a chronicle does not pay their annual dues and is not
                given a discount by Council, they will lose their full
                member status and become a probationary chronicle.
                1.  A loss of full member status caused by non-payment
                    of dues will be reversed when the annual dues are
                    paid or by a simple majority vote from Council.

        <!-- -->

        2.  If there is additional money remaining after the yearly
            server costs, additional revenue will be added to a Server
            Reserve fund.
        3.  Failure to pay chronicle dues will result in the following
            disciplinary action:
            1.  One to two weeks after the due date for chronicle dues
                has passed, the Finance Coordinator shall send a private
                email to the Head Storyteller and Council Representative
                of the overdue chronicle, requesting action on the part
                of the Chronicle.
            2.  One month after the due date, the Finance Coordinator
                shall send a message to the OWBN-Council and OWBN-ST
                e-mail lists. This message shall include a list of
                chronicles that have not submitted chronicle dues and
                shall request immediate contact from those chronicles.
            3.  Bi-weekly (once every other week) requests for contact
                shall continue until three months after the due date. If
                chronicle dues have not been submitted for three months
                past the due date the chronicle shall no longer be
                eligible for plot from Genre Coordinators, including
                Non-Player Character appearances at major events. The
                Finance Coordinator is responsible for notifying
                Coordinators of the status of delinquent chronicles.
            4.  From six months past the due date and beyond, with no
                attempt made to set up a reasonable time frame in which
                to submit chronicle dues, and no request to the OWBN
                Council made for an exemption, the chronicle will be put
                on probation. The chronicle will lose all voting rights
                but will not be removed from any e-mail list(s).
            5.  Nine months after a chronicle has completely failed to
                submit chronicle dues or any arrangements for either
                delayed chronicle dues or exemption, the chronicle will
                be expelled from OWBN.

        <!-- -->

        4.  These measures are cumulative; meaning that while the
            chronicle is on probation it is also not eligible for plot
            from the Genre Coordinators. All measures short of expulsion
            are immediately ended upon submitting all due chronicle
            dues.
            1.  A chronicle may request an extension from the Finance
                Coordinator, who shall accept and grant such requests at
                his/her discretion. Such requests shall not be
                considered if the Chronicle provides false information.
            2.  Failure to meet an extended due date granted by the
                Finance Coordinator causes the process to resume where
                it left off.
            3.  A Chronicle may also request an exemption from the OWBN
                Council, at any time, including during the disciplinary
                procedure outlined above.
            4.  Exemptions granted by the OWBN Council give the
                chronicle the right to not submit chronicle dues for the
                duration outlined in the granted exemption.

    <!-- -->

    4.  Server Fees
        1.  The cost for the maintenance of the server will not exceed
            \$2500.00 USD per year, to be paid as invoices are received.

    <!-- -->

    5.  Marketing Budget
        1.  The Marketing budget will be \$500.00 per year, allocated as
            invoices are received.

    <!-- -->

    6.  Reporting Requirements
        1.  The Financial Coordinator shall make an annual report and it
            shall be due Dec. 1 for the year. The Financial Coordinator
            may request extensions for these dates from the Head
            Coordinator.
        2.  Reports shall include a listing of all chronicles that have
            paid, costs for the year and current funds available and
            locations of funds (IE paypal or bank account).

<!-- -->

6.  Disciplinary Policy
    1.  Board of Inquiry
        1.  Council shall preside over any disciplinary case that could
            result in an OWbN-wide punishment that is proposed as a
            Disciplinary Action.

    <!-- -->

    2.  Issuing a OWBN Disciplinary Action
        1.  To initiate an OWBN Disciplinary Action a proposal must be
            submitted to Council proposing an action against a member,
            where a member is defined as an individual who participates
            in OWBN.
            1.  A disciplinary proposal explicitly does not require that
                a formal bylaw has been violated by the accused member.
                Council may utilize the disciplinary procedures to issue
                disciplinary action any time it feels the shared values
                of the community have been violated in some way.
            2.  Any person has the right to keep their private out of
                character communications to themselves. They are not
                required to supply any out of character documentation
                that they deem as private to anyone.

        <!-- -->

        2.  The individual member to be issued with an OWBN Disciplinary
            Action must be sent notification at the same time the
            proposal is made to Council, via email, or any other
            acceptable means of notification, and that must be
            documented within the proposal and done so by the person
            proposing the Disciplinary Action.
            1.  If after 24 Hours of the notification of the proposal,
                the Individual has not responded in any fashion that
                they have been made aware of the proposal, it becomes
                the Head Coordinator's responsibility to make sure the
                person becomes aware of the proposal in a timely manner,
                and all attempts must be documented and presented to
                council for review.
            2.  The individual member has the right to defend themselves
                to Council by either any Council Member who is willing
                to do so or a member of the Executive Team.
            3.  The discussion period for a disciplinary action is
                normally seven (7) days. The Head Coordinator may extend
                this discussion for any reason, for up to
                twenty-one (21) additional days, up to a maximum
                discussion period of twenty-eight (28) days. Any further
                extension requires a Council vote. The voting period for
                the disciplinary action shall not begin until the
                discussion period has concluded.
            4.  If no response has been received from the member within
                the allotted time, and due diligence has been made by
                the Head Coordinator in an attempt to do so, then the
                member shall have forfeited the right to a Defense.

        <!-- -->

        3.  Head Coordinator (HC) and Assistant Head Coordinators (AHCs)
            may seek further information as they see fit for the case.
            Should it be necessary, the HC and AHCs may appoint a team
            of members to act as their Subcoordinators for the length of
            the proposal process to investigate the situation.
        4.  The results of the investigation and supporting evidence
            must be made available to the Council for assessment before
            the voting period begins.
        5.  The Disciplinary Action must be ratified by a majority vote
            of the Council. The Head Coordinator breaks ties in all
            Disciplinary Actions.
        6.  The vote for a Disciplinary Action will only determine the
            “guilt” or the “innocence” of the individual member accused.
            If the majority of Council determines that the individual is
            “guilty,” a second vote opens, lasting seven (7) days to
            determine the punishment to be levied against them.
        7.  The punishment vote will offer all OWBN Disciplinary Actions
            that apply to the individual and the situation, in
            accordance with the bylaws. A Council Member may vote for
            only one option, with the understanding that they agree to
            any lesser punishment as an alternative to their choice. The
            result of the punishment vote will be determined by counting
            votes from the most severe option down through each lower
            punishment until a majority has been achieved.
        8.  The punishment options are ranked as below, with the first
            option being the most severe.
            1.  Permanent Ban
            2.  Indefinite Ban/3 Strikes
            3.  Temporary Ban
            4.  2 Strikes
            5.  1 Strike
            6.  Probation
            7.  Censure
            8.  Condemnation

        <!-- -->

        9.  If the member's behavior is a violation of OWBN rules and
            values as decided by the Head Coordinator (HC), the Head
            Coordinator may order an immediate ban of that member from
            OWBN, whether or not that member has already been
            disciplined by a chronicle for that behavior.
            1.  Following this ban, the Head Coordinator must initiate a
                disciplinary proposal to council proposing the ban
                action within fourteen (14) days. If this vote fails or
                the proposal is not made, the ban is reversed and all
                effects of the ban are removed from the member.

    <!-- -->

    3.  Disciplinary Action Procedure for Council
        1.  There will be two representatives during every Disciplinary
            Action:
            1.  Representative for the accuser(s)
                1.  This representative will be the individual who
                    proposed the Disciplinary Action
                2.  If it is a member of the Executive Team, that member
                    will not be permitted to be a moderator for this
                    particular proposal.
                3.  If it is a member of the Executive Team, that member
                    will not be permitted to be a moderator for this
                    particular proposal.
                4.  Representatives for the accuser may speak about this
                    private proposal, for the purpose of gathering
                    information related to the case.

            <!-- -->

            2.  Representative for the accused
                1.  If it is a member of the Executive Team, that member
                    will not be permitted to be a moderator for this
                    particular proposal.
                2.  The Representative and Defendant: May discuss the
                    proposal for the purpose of gathering a defense. The
                    accused may also speak on the proposal to whomever
                    they like.

        <!-- -->

        2.  During the discussion phase, all questions regarding the
            proposed disciplinary action will be sent directly to an
            appropriate representative with the Executive Team, as a
            neutral party, copied on the email. No
            questions/comments/concerns regarding the contents of the DA
            will be posted to Council by individual Council Members not
            serving as representatives.
            1.  The representatives may offer paraphrased versions of
                questions to represent multiple individuals asking the
                same thing, or to remove leading or suggestive phrasing.
            2.  Representatives will post questions, along with the
                appropriate responses, to Council stating whether a
                Coordinator or a Council Member asked them, without
                naming the specific office, chronicle or individual.

        <!-- -->

        3.  With the exception of the Executive Team in their role as
            mediators and moderators and the representatives for the
            accuser and accused, any Council Member or Coordinator who
            posts questions/comments/concerns to Council in a
            Disciplinary Action Discussion will be placed on moderation
            immediately for 24 hours.
            1.  Further violations of this restriction will result in a
                Disciplinary Action against the Council Member or
                Coordinator in question.

        <!-- -->

        4.  For all matters involving violations of the Code of Conduct,
            a member of the Executive Team must represent the accuser.
        5.  Disciplinary Action votes will be blind, meaning that
            individual votes and comments will not be visible until the
            vote is closed.

    <!-- -->

    4.  Treatment of Old Disciplinary Actions
        1.  Unless noted in the original proposal, all members with
            disciplinary actions shall be subject to the restrictions,
            conditions and durations in effect at the time they were
            issued.
        2.  Members with disciplinary actions that have been reversed or
            reduced are subject to the restrictions, conditions and
            durations of their reversed or reduced disciplinary action
            in effect at the time of the reversal or reduction.

    <!-- -->

    5.  Disciplinary Actions
        1.  OWBN Condemnation
            1.  This action is to allow Council to condemn an action
                that does not deserve other punishment. A Condemnation
                action will stay on the Archivist's records unless it is
                successfully appealed.

        <!-- -->

        2.  OWBN Censure
            1.  Consequences of OWBN Censure
                1.  No member holding any OWBN Censure shall be
                    permitted to hold any of the following positions in
                    OWBN: Council Member, Sub-Coordinators or Portraying
                    NPCs for Coordinators or Sub-Coordinators.
                2.  Should any member receive three OWBN Censures, that
                    player will be treated as though having received an
                    OWBN Strike.

        <!-- -->

        3.  OWBN Strike
            1.  Consequences of OWBN Strikes
                1.  No member holding any OWBN Strikes shall be
                    permitted to hold any position within OWBN at the
                    organizational level. Organizational Level positions
                    are: Coordinators, Sub-Coordinators, Council
                    Members, and Portraying NPCs for Coordinators or
                    Sub-Coordinators.
                2.  No member holding two OWbN Strikes shall be
                    permitted to hold the position of Storyteller,
                    Assistant Storyteller, narrator, or similar within
                    an OWbN Chronicle, full, probationary, satellite, or
                    otherwise.
                3.  Should any member receive three OWBN Strikes, that
                    player will no longer be eligible to play in any
                    OWBN Chronicle, nor hold any position within OWBN.

        <!-- -->

        4.  Removal of Storyteller
            1.  A proposal must be made to remove an ST by 2/3 majority,
                if no disciplinary actions are being rendered or
                proposed that would prohibit an ST from holding a
                position.
            2.  Procedure that proposal is made followed by one week of
                discussion, one week of voting for removal. Subsequent
                to this will be the determination of length of time that
                ST is not permitted to hold chronicle administrative
                positions at either 6 months, one year, or indefinitely.
            3.  Overturning the removal of a Storyteller requires 2/3
                majority vote, following proposal to Council.

        <!-- -->

        5.  OWBN Probation
            1.  Upon ratification of the action and notification of the
                member, the member receiving a Probation Action is
                restricted to interacting with a single chronicle. The
                member is not permitted access to the national e-mail
                lists of OWBN for the duration of the probation; neither
                may they serve OWBN in any organizational level position
                during this time.
            2.  Probations last for six (6) months, but may be extended
                through additional disciplinary proposals.

        <!-- -->

        6.  OWBN Temporary Ban
            1.  A temporary ban action lasts for six (6) months, after
                which a six (6) month Probation occurs. During that
                probation the member may serve in no position, at either
                the chronicle or OWBN level.
            2.  Upon ratification of the ban and notification of the
                member the member will not be allowed to interact with
                OWBN in any capacity for the duration of the action.

        <!-- -->

        7.  OWBN Indefinite Ban
            1.  This Disciplinary Action grants three (3) OWBN Strikes
                in one (1) action and will be recorded as the member
                having received three (3) OWBN strikes, which will be
                treated as separate actions for reversal.

        <!-- -->

        8.  Removal from Office
            1.  This action may be combined with any other action or
                combination of actions.
            2.  This action may only be taken against a Coordinator
                mentioned in the Coordinator Bylaws, Section 1, or a
                sub-coordinator of one of those positions.
            3.  The proposal containing this action against an elected
                Coordinator must pass with the most votes to remove
                them. The Head Coordinator is obligated to use his or
                her vote to break the tie, if necessary.
            4.  Upon ratification of the removal the member will no
                longer serve OWBN in the position previously held. This
                action may not be reversed.

        <!-- -->

        9.  OWBN Permanent Ban
            1.  This Disciplinary Action requires a 2/3 majority vote to
                enact, and permanently bans the person from interaction
                with OWBN in any capacity unless specifically overturned
                by council proposal. No proposal to reduce or change
                this action may be made until six (6) months after the
                ban has been enacted. A proposal to reduce or change a
                Permanent Ban must also receive a 2/3 majority vote to
                enact.

    <!-- -->

    6.  Process for appeal or reversal
        1.  Reversal of OWBN Disciplinary Actions
            1.  Any member who has received an OWBN disciplinary action
                may apply for a reversal of the action through a
                proposal seeking reversal of the action from a Council
                Member, AHC or the HC after one half (1/2) the assigned
                duration or six (6) months in the case of a strike. Only
                one action may be reversed per proposal.
            2.  Only one such proposal on behalf of a member will be
                considered per three hundred sixty five (365) days
                beginning at the ratification of the first action given
                to the member.
            3.  If the reversal would reduce the number of strikes held
                by the member to two (2), the Head Coordinator must make
                the proposal and the member will receive a Probation
                Disciplinary Action for a duration of six (6) months.
            4.  Any strikes reversed in this way shall be noted as
                reversed in the Archivist's record.

        <!-- -->

        2.  Appeal of OWBN Disciplinary Actions
            1.  Should new evidence about a disciplinary action become
                available, a Council Member, an Assistant Head
                Coordinator or the Head Coordinator may introduce a
                proposal to appeal the original vote.
            2.  If the appeal is ratified, the appealed action is
                nullified and will be treated as though that action's
                vote failed.

    <!-- -->

    7.  Archiving
        1.  All OWBN Disciplinary Actions must be logged in the
            Disciplinary Action Report by a member of the Executive Team
            at the conclusion of the punishment vote.
            1.  The Disciplinary Action Report is available to all STs,
                Council Members, and Coordinators via their Vineyard
                Dashboard.
            2.  They may ask the Archivist for the list of players, or
                may inquire after a particular member in that regard.

        <!-- -->

        2.  Following the reinstating of full member status, all
            positions denied through Probation or Temporary Ban Actions
            \[see section 6.d Disciplinary Actions\] are again available
            to the member. Also, record of the action will be removed
            from the record of Disciplinary Actions.
        3.  The result of an OWBN Disciplinary Action Vote must be
            announced on the ST and Council mailing lists.
        4.  At any time during the duration and within seven (7) days
            after the end of the Probation or Temporary Ban disciplinary
            actions, the Council Member of the chronicle with which the
            member is interacting may file a report on the member's
            conduct and a recommendation to grant another disciplinary
            action equal to the one ratified by council.
            1.  If probation follows a ban, the additional option of
                granting another ban of the same duration as the
                original is available to be recommended.
            2.  If there are no objections to this recommendation within
                one (1) week, the recommendation will be executed as
                though it were a successful vote.
            3.  If an objection is made, the recommendation may either
                be withdrawn or resubmitted as a proposal.
            4.  If neither a withdrawal nor proposal happens within
                seven (7) days of the objection, then it will be treated
                as though no recommendation had been made.
            5.  Should no recommendation be made, the member will be
                reinstated to full membership status. The duration of
                this action will be the duration of the original
                proposal.

    <!-- -->

    8.  Local Disciplinary Matters
        1.  Chronicle discipline is the province of the chronicle staff,
            however the chronicle staff must enforce however
            disciplinary actions passed by Council.
        2.  Visitors to a chronicle are subject to the disciplinary
            procedures of the chronicle that they visit, just as their
            characters are subject to the actions of the game under
            Character Regulation Bylaws 4.

<!-- -->

7.  Chronicle Admission
    1.  Minimum Requirements for Application of Membership into the
        network
        1.  Be active as a chronicle for a minimum of 6 months or 12
            game sessions within a one-year period, whichever is longer,
            prior applying to OWBN for membership.  
            Complete all applicable sections of the OWBN Admission form
            and submit it the Membership Coordinator. Please refer to
            the OWBN website for the admissions Form and the current
            e-mail address.
            1.  Include a copy of their written disciplinary procedures
                with their Application.
            2.  Include a copy of any house rules.

    <!-- -->

    2.  Application Review
        1.  The Membership Coordinator, a Sub-Coordinator, or a duly
            appointed representative will be assigned to the Application
            to review it and work with the prospective chronicle to work
            out any questions or concerns from the Genre Coordinators
            and chronicles, including mediation of territory disputes,
            which may be kicked up to the exec team for mediation if any
            party requests their involvement.
        2.  The Membership Coordinator, a Sub-Coordinator, or a duly
            appointed representative will then work with the prospective
            chronicle to shift/adjust any plots that need to be modified
            to fit into the OWBN structure.

    <!-- -->

    3.  Probationary Vote
        1.  The Membership Coordinator will then submit the Application
            for a “Probationary Admission” vote to Council for the
            discussion period and Admission Vote. If there are no
            objections during the discussion period, the game Autopasses
            into its Probationary Period.
            1.  Possible results for the initial admissions Vote are:
                1.  Admission to OWBN for a 6-12 Month probation
                2.  Denial of admission
                    1.  Any Full Membership Chronicle or Exec Team
                        Member may object to a chronicles Probationary
                        Admission, causing it to go to a vote.

            <!-- -->

            2.  Admissions Votes require no Second.
            3.  If during this time there are concerns raised by Council
                about the application, the Membership Staff will work
                with the prospective chronicle to work out any questions

            together).
        2.  A Satellite Game shall be defined by the following
            characteristics:

            dispute. This decision may be appealed first to the Exec
            Team, and then to Council.
        6.  Satellite games will be treated as separate games for the
            purposes of reporting and record-keeping.
        7.  Satellite Games to Full Membership going through the
            admissions process are held to both the rules and

            the OWbN website, to be submitted via their Chronicle
            Information Form

                official policy of the chronicle.
            2.  It is the responsibility of the chronicle staff to
                submit updates or revisions to the disciplinary policies

            date on which this approval was given, the name and
            chronicle of an OWBN ST who has approved it and will take
            responsibility for its existence in the network.
        2.  The ST who originally approves an item card for play in OWBN
            may be held accountable to Council for its existence. Items
            that may be more then they appear should have distinct
            marking instructing the user to contact that ST for further
            information or simply limit the use of the item to their own
            chronicle.
        3.  STs may refuse to allow cards they do not approve of to
            enter play in their game. If an ST feels that a card may be
            very damaging to the network, he or she may confiscate the
            card from the visiting player, and return it directly to the
            responsible STs.

                1.  A submitted report may be denied by the Archivists
                    if they deem it incomplete or improper.
                    1.  The Archivists must justify their denial and

                    2.  The chronicle may appeal to the Exec Team if
                        they disagree with the decision. The Exec Team
                        will then decide if the report is to be accepted
                        or redone.

            8.  Failure to submit chronicle reports will result in the
                following disciplinary action:
                1.  One to two weeks after the due date for chronicle
                    reports has passed, the Archivist shall send a
                    private email, to the Head Storyteller and Council
                    Representative of the overdue chronicle, requesting
                    action on the part of the Chronicle.
                2.  One month after the due date, the Archivist shall
                    send a message to the OWBN-Council and OWBN-ST
                    e-mail lists. This message shall include a list of
                    chronicles that have not submitted a chronicle
                    report and shall request immediate contact from
                    those chronicles.
                3.  Requests for contact shall continue until three
                    months after the due date. If a chronicle report has
                    not been submitted for three months past the due
                    date the chronicle shall no longer be eligible for
                    plot from Genre Coordinators, including Non-Player
                    Character appearances at major events. The Archivist
                    is responsible for notifying Coordinators of the
                    status of delinquent chronicles and working out
                    methods to compromise plot problems should it prove
                    necessary.
                4.  From six months past the due date and beyond, with
                    no attempt made to set up a reasonable time frame in
                    which to submit chronicle reports, and no request to
                    the OWBN Council made for an exemption, the
                    chronicle will be put on probation. The chronicle
                    will lose all voting rights, but will not be removed
                    from any e-mail list(s).
                5.  Nine months after a chronicle has completely failed
                    to submit chronicle reports or any arrangements for
                    either delayed chronicle reports or exemption, the
                    chronicle will be expelled from OWBN.

            <!-- -->

            9.  These measures are cumulative; meaning that while the
                chronicle is on probation it is also not eligible for
                plot from the Genre Coordinators. All measures short of
                expulsion are immediately ended upon submitting all due
                chronicle reports.
                1.  A chronicle may request an extension from the
                    Archivist who shall accept and grant such requests
                    at his/her discretion. Such requests shall not be
                    considered if the Chronicle provides false
                    information.
                2.  Failure to meet an extended due date granted by the
                    Archivist causes the process to resume where it left
                    off.
                3.  A Chronicle may also request an exemption from the
                    OWBN Council, at any time, including during the
                    disciplinary procedure outlined above.
                4.  Exemptions granted by the OWBN Council give the
                    chronicle the right to not submit chronicle reports
                    for the duration outlined in the granted exemption.

            10. In the case of Satellite Games, disciplinary actions
                will be placed upon both the Satellite Game and the Full
                Member Chronicle under whose authority they are
                registered.

9.  Internet Presence
    1.  Official Site
        1.  OWBN.NET shall be recognized as being the official website
            of this organization, and that it shall be the primary
            representation of our organization to the public, insofar as
            a presence on the World Wide Web.
        2.  The domain belongs to the One World By Night NPO, registered
            in Canada.
        3.  Content on any site hosted by OWBN.NET shall belong to the
            network, or White Wolf, Inc. unless otherwise noted.
            1.  The Grapevine LARP Administration utility will be hosted
                on the OWBN.NET servers, but still belong to its
                creator, Adam Cerling.

    2.  Code of Conduct for the Council, Storyteller, and Coordinator
        List-Servers
        1.  Please remain considerate, professional, and act with
            civility towards others.
        2.  If you are determined to be acting in violation, simply
            apologize and amend your behavior(s). The Executive Team
            will determine if you are in violation of the Code of
            Conduct.
        3.  If you persist in the behavior(s) after being warned to
            stop, you will be placed on moderation for up to one week.
            Moderated posts will be screened by the Executive Team for
            continued violations before being shared.
            1.  Council Members placed on moderation that are attempting
                to post items related to their duties, such as seconding
                or objecting to proposals, may have their posts edited
                to remove any violations to the Code of Conduct before
                the item is shared with Council.
            2.  The Executive Team will not use moderation or the Code
                of Conduct as a means of silencing debate or discussion
                related to the official duties of Council Members,
                Storytellers, or Coordinators.
            3.  Should no further violations occur, moderation will end
                within 24 hours.

        <!-- -->

        4.  In addition to moderation, official disciplinary actions may
            be proposed for the Code of Conduct violation, or for
            continued violations of the Code of Conduct, including any
            occurring during moderation.
        5.  All communication on the Council, Storyteller, and
            Coordinator lists must include the name of the person
            communicating (which must match the assigned name on the
            chronicle information portion of the OWbN website). This may
            include commonly known as names (but does not limit
            including more information).
    3.  Email Lists
        1.  Due to the mature themes portrayed in OWBN, all
            organizational lists not specifically designated by their
            moderators as "safe for children" are restricted to those
            members of the organization who are no longer minors as
            legally defined by their governments.
        2.  A Council Member may petition a list moderator on behalf of
            one of their underage players, who may or may not make an
            exception for that player. Whatever method the Council
            Member uses to determine whether they will petition on
            behalf of a player is left to the chronicle.
        3.  Any mailing list, forum, newsgroup, or other form of IC
            communication must allow membership for the storytellers of
            any character who is a member of the list/group. Such access
            may be designated 'read only' at the discretion of the
            moderator of the list/group. Information and communications
            from any group that does not meet these criteria shall be
            considered invalid for use in OWBN.

10. White Wolf/CCP/Onyx Path/By Night Publishing Source Materials
    1.  To allow time for all members of OWBN to research new materials
        as they become published a ban shall be placed on the
        acquisition of any new power, ability, background, item, item
        card, merit, flaw, etc. from any new publication outside of an
        OWbN approved Packet made after January 1, 2010 by any PC or
        NPC, which may be released following a three-month period by
        vote of Council. Meta-plots, as passed by Council, are exempt.
    2.  5th Edition Products are not acceptable source material for One
        World by Night.
        1.  Any game wishing to bring in specific plot or mechanic
            elements from 5th Edition material must put forth a proposal
            requiring a 2/3 majority to pass. Should that proposal pass,
            that material may be used in OWbN.

    <!-- -->

    3.  The following books are disallowed for use within OWBN
        1.  World of Darkness: Gypsies

<!-- -->

11. Legal Position
    1.  OWBN will not be held legally responsible for the activities of
        its individual members.
    2.  OWBN will not become involved in any case that is brought before
        a court of law in any country, other than as a witness to an
        alleged crime. In such a case, the Head Coordinator may allow
        release, as specifically requested by the courts, of any
        evidence that may be held by OWBN (such as archived e-mails).
    3.  OWBN will make available such disciplinary measures as are
        required to deal with individual complaints, either to direct
        them to the appropriate solution (which may include directing
        them back to a chronicle) or dealing with the issue itself if
        deemed necessary.
    4.  OWBN will not become embroiled in personal disputes unrelated to
        OWBN, nor should OWBN be used as a vehicle for such disputes.
