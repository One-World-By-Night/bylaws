  <i
    >One World by Night (OWbN) is a network of international Live Action Role
    Play (LARP) chronicles. These chronicles are brought together for the
    purpose of sharing a broad and colorful story that extends past each
    city&#39;s borders. We believe in the sovereignty of each chronicle, so far
    as it does not impugn upon the cohesiveness of the organization as a whole.
    We further believe that treating each chronicle, and by extension each
    player, with respect is the bedrock upon which sound cooperative
    Storytelling takes place.</i

        What is a Chronicle?
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>
            A chronicle is a geographically localized body of players, including
            STs and a Council Member. The Council Member is assumed to represent
            the will of the chronicle to OWbN, however the Council Member is not
            assumed to have the ownership of the chronicle, which is assumed to
            belong to the body of players as a whole, including the STs and
            Council Member. Players may also be members of multiple chronicles.

        Chronicle Boundaries and Control
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>
            Chronicles have full control over the events inside of their
            boundaries. These boundaries are registered with the Membership
            Coordinator, but should be well known to surrounding chronicles.
            Storytellers wishing to run scenes in another chronicles boundaries
            must first obtain permission from a Storyteller from that chronicle.
            A chronicle may only claim territory that is considered a reasonable
            distance from its IC location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Territorial disputes may be taken to the executive team for
            mediation.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a chronicle runs scenes outside their territory, in any
            capacity, they may not draw significant public attention nor create
            events that would affect other chronicles. They may not create
            actions that would damage or alter the political/social landscape of
            the area or that would cause the area to deviate from the
            &quot;status quo&quot;.

          <li>
            Frequently characters interact with other characters not only in
            their own game, but due to travel and internet mediums also in other
            chronicles. There are times in which certain aspects need to be
            removed from the continuity of the overall story of OWbN. A
            &quot;retcon&quot; is defined as removing a specific thing from the
            continuity of OWbN Story. This &quot;thing&quot; can be as simple as
            a single spoken word by a (non)player character, to more complicated
            things such as role-play scenes (either in person, or online
            mediums), combats, or following the specific rules outlined in
            Character Bylaws - even character death. When an item is retconned,
            that item is removed from play as if that item never existed, and
            the greater world at large, as well as (non)player-characters will
            react equally as if the item never existed.
            <ol style="list-style-type: Decimal">

                Retconning may only be performed by an HST of a OWbN Chronicle.

                Retconning must be submitted to the relevant parties within 6

                Retconning that happen which have any potential to have had
                information of the item in question, must be submitted to the
                OWbN Storyteller list to ensure all chronicles are aware of the
                retcon and can attempt to reinforce the change to continuity of
                OWbN&#39;s overall story.

              <li>
                Retconning of items which erase continuity for characters with a
                current or former Binding Agreement, must be mediated with the
                Coordinator who held the Binding agreement.

                    This is meant to ensure that any changes in continuity while

            Chronicles may not direct STs or players that events in other
            chronicles did not happen in their local chronicle continuity.
            Events in OWbN chronicles are part of the OWbN continuity, and must
            be accepted as valid IC events for all OWbN, unless retconned by the
            originating STs or Council. Chronicles may, however, lessen or
            change any effects that outside events might have on their local
            chronicle as long as these changes do not fundamentally alter or end
            the plot. This does not apply to OWBN Council approved plot, which
            must be run as passed.

                    Exception votes require a 2/3 majority of council in order

                Such votes may proceed, but are automatically held to the higher
                standard. For example, if a chronicle wishes to enter OWBN with
                a Very Rare PC, their admissions vote requires a 2/3 majority
                rather than a simple majority.

                When feasible, it is permissible to break any item requiring a
                supermajority into a separate vote. For example, an apply game
                with a Very Rare R&amp;U PC may be presented as two proposals -
                one for basic admission, which would require a simple majority,
                and one for the admission of the Very Rare PC, which would
                require the standard 2/3 majority of a Very Rare R&amp;U vote.
                Failure of the secondary vote blocks only the Very Rare PC from
                entering play, not the rest of the chronicle.
